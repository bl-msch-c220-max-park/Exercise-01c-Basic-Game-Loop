This exercise will give you our first taste of solving a problem using programming. You will be implementing a basic game loop.

Begin by Forking this repository. Check that it has been forked successfully; the repository should now read [your username]/Exercise-01c-Basic-Game-Loop

Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F21 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location. Make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-01c-Basic-Game-Loop" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open the folder in VS Code. You should see four files: .gitignore, LICENSE, main.py, and README.md. Open main.py.
